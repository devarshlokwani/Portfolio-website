 * the silhouette: fold lines ran past the flanks into open sky and across
 * the range behind, and every crossing read as a mistake, which is what made
 * the skyline look tangled rather than drawn.
 *
 * Massifs are also narrower and more numerous than they were. At a half
 * width of five hundred pixels a peak is wider than the canvas is tall and
 * reads as a dune; a range needs its summits close enough together to be

 * The hand-inked country the flight crosses. One long panorama laid out

 *
 * Depth is built two ways. Bands set the vertical order, three ranges, two
 * runs of rolling hills, the settled valley and the road, and
 * every landform in front is *filled with the paper color* so it occludes
 * what stands behind it, which is what stops ridgelines from crossing into
 * an X. Horizontally, everything on the ground is placed through `Lane`
 * occupancy rather than by spacing alone, so a barn never lands on a church
 * and a paddock never straddles a field.
